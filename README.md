---

## 📅 Day 1 – Java Generics Overview 
**(Date: 15-Jan-2026)**                    
**Branch:** `java-collections-practice`

Studied the Java Collections Framework to manage groups of objects efficiently using built-in data structures. Learned the difference between Collection and Map interfaces and their real-world use cases.

#### 🔹 Created a new branch `java-collections-practice`
- Learned and applied Java Generics best practices:
  - Generic classes, methods, and constructors
  - Bounded type parameters and wildcards
  - Type safety and reusability

#### 🔹 Topics Learned
- Type safety with generics
- Generic classes, methods, and constructors
- Upper & lower bounded wildcards
- Bounded type parameters
- Avoiding raw types and type erasure pitfalls
- Designing clean and reusable generic APIs
  
#### 🔹 Implemented real-world generic systems:
  - Smart Warehouse Management
  - Online Marketplace
  - Course Management System
  - Meal Plan Generator
  - AI-Driven Resume Screening System

## 📅 Day 2 – Java Collections Framework  
**(Date: 16-Jan-2026)** 
**Branch:** `java-collections-practice`

Learned and practiced the **Java Collections Framework** in depth:

#### ✔ Core Topics Covered
- Collection hierarchy: `List`, `Set`, `Queue`, `Map`
- Implementations:
  - **List:** ArrayList, LinkedList, Vector
  - **Set:** HashSet, LinkedHashSet, TreeSet
  - **Queue/Deque:** PriorityQueue, ArrayDeque
  - **Map:** HashMap, LinkedHashMap, TreeMap, Hashtable
- Performance comparison & real-world use cases
- Best practices: generics, choosing correct collection, avoiding legacy misuse

#### ✔ Practice Problems Implemented
- **List operations:** reverse, rotate, frequency count, remove duplicates
- **Set operations:** union, intersection, subsets, sorting
- **Queue problems:** reverse queue, triage system, circular buffer
- **Map problems:** word frequency, merge maps, grouping objects
- **Mini systems:**
  - Insurance Policy Management
  - Banking System
  - Voting System
  - Shopping Cart

## 📅 Day 3 – Java File Handling & I/O Streams
**(Date: 19-01-2026)**
**(Focus: File Handling, Buffered Streams, Serialization & Advanced I/O)**

- > Studied Java File Handling and I/O Streams to understand how Java reads and writes data using byte and character streams.

- > Learned the difference between basic file streams and buffered streams, and how buffering improves performance for large file operations.

- > Practiced reading user input from the console and writing structured data into files using reader and writer classes.

- > Explored object serialization and deserialization to store and retrieve Java objects using ObjectInputStream and ObjectOutputStream.

- > Worked with ByteArray streams, data streams, piped streams, and large-file processing to handle real-world I/O scenarios efficiently.

## 📅 Day 4 – Java: Exception Handling
**(Date: 20-01-2026)**
**(Focus: Handling Runtime Errors and Building Robust Applications)**

- > Studied Java Exception Handling to manage runtime errors and prevent abnormal program termination.

- > Learned the use of try, catch, finally, throw, and throws keywords for controlled error handling.

- > Explored checked vs unchecked exceptions and common exceptions like NullPointerException, ArithmeticException, and IOException.

- > Practiced creating and using custom exceptions for application-specific error scenarios.

- > Focused on writing robust, readable, and maintainable code with proper exception-handling best practices.

## 📅 Day 5 – Java Fundamentals: Regex & JUnit
**(Date: 21-01-2026)**
**Focus: Regular Expressions & Unit Testing**

- > Studied Regex basics including metacharacters and quantifiers for building effective patterns.

- > Implemented common regex use cases such as email validation, password strength checks, and phone number formatting.

- > Worked with the Java Regex API, using Pattern and Matcher classes for pattern matching.

- > Practiced important regex methods: find(), matches(), and replaceAll() for string validation and manipulation.

- > Learned JUnit fundamentals including annotations, test case writing, test class structure, and assertions for validating logic.

## 📅 Day 6 – Java Collections & Core Java: Reflection and Annotations
**(Date: 22-01-2026)**
**(Focus: Runtime Metadata & Dynamic Behavior in Java)**

- > Studied Java Reflection to inspect classes, methods, fields, and constructors at runtime.

- > Learned how to access and invoke methods dynamically and analyze class metadata using the Reflection API.

- > Explored Java Annotations to add metadata to classes, methods, and fields.

- > Understood the use of custom annotations and how they are processed at runtime using reflection.
