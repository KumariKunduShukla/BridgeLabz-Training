# Week 3: Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)

This repository documents my **daily learning progress in Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using **Java**. It includes conceptual understanding, hands-on implementations, and well-structured code following best practices.

## 📅 Day 1 – Linked List
**🗓 Date:** 02-01-2026  
**🎯 Focus:** DSA Fundamentals – Linked List Variants

### 🔹 Overview
Linked List is a **dynamic linear data structure** that stores elements in nodes instead of contiguous memory locations. Each node contains data and one or more references (links).

### 🔹 Concepts Covered
- Importance of **DSA** in efficient problem-solving
- Advantages of Linked Lists over arrays
- Structure of a node (data + reference)

### 🔹 Types of Linked Lists
- **Singly Linked List** – Traversal in one direction using `next`
- **Doubly Linked List** – Traversal in both directions using `previous` and `next`
- **Circular Linked List** – Last node points back to the first node

### 🔹 Operations Implemented
- Insertion
- Deletion
- Traversal
- Searching

### 🔹 Key Learnings
- Pointer-based logic using Java references
- Writing clean and readable DSA code
- Proper naming conventions and formatting

## 📅 Day 2 – Stack, Queue & Hashing
**🗓 Date:** 03-01-2026  
**🎯 Focus:** DSA Fundamentals – Stack, Queue, HashMap & Hashing

### 🔹 Stack
- Linear data structure following **LIFO (Last In, First Out)**
- Operations implemented:
  - `push`
  - `pop`
  - `peek`
  - `isEmpty`

### 🔹 Queue
- Linear data structure following **FIFO (First In, First Out)**
- Operations implemented:
  - `enqueue`
  - `dequeue`
  - `front`
  - `rear`
- Explored real-world applications of Queue

### 🔹 Hashing & HashMap
- Concept of **hashing** for fast data access
- Understanding **HashMap** as key–value storage
- Studied:
  - Hash functions
  - Collision handling
  - Efficient searching

### 🔹 Practical Implementation
- Implemented Stack, Queue, and HashMap using **Java**
- Improved understanding of **time complexity and performance optimization**

### 🔹 Code Quality
- Clean, readable, and modular code
- Consistent indentation and formatting
- Programs organized systematically in DSA practice branch

## 📅 Day 3 – Sorting Techniques
**Date: 05 January 2026**
**Focus: Sorting Algorithms**

Studied the importance of sorting for efficient data management and search performance.

Learned and implemented:

Bubble Sort – adjacent element swapping.

Selection Sort – selecting the minimum element iteratively.

Insertion Sort – inserting elements in a sorted subarray.

Merge Sort – divide and conquer approach.

Quick Sort – pivot-based partitioning.

Counting Sort – for limited integer ranges.

Heap Sort – binary heap extraction.

Compared sorting algorithms by time complexity, space complexity, and stability.

Focused on clean, optimized DSA code following best practices.

## 📅 Day 4 – Searching, StringBuffer, StringBuilder & File Handling
**Date: 06 January 2026**
**Focus: String Handling, Searching & File I/O**

Studied StringBuffer and StringBuilder to understand mutable strings and performance differences.

Practiced searching algorithms: linear search and binary search.

Implemented file handling using BufferedReader for efficient reading.

Focused on clean, readable, and optimized Java code.
